IMPORTANT: MakeTips.aspx does not submit the given tip-set to the database. We gave it a serious attempt (see the commented code in MakeTips.aspx.cs), but, due to difficulty obtaining data for within <asp:ListView>, we were unable to complete this functionally. We are hoping to recieve partial marks for our attempt.

All other pages should be fully functional.
